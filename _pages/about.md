I am a PhD researcher at [LIRIS](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/decision-sciences-and-information-management/liris), KU Leuven, specializing in Machine Learning for geospatial data and real estate, supervised by [Jochen De Weerdt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=nl&authuser=1&user=26i8eZMAAAAJ) (KU Leuven) and [Seppe vanden Broucke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uIfUaMMAAAAJ&hl=nl&authuser=1) (UGent). I hold an MSc in Business and Information Systems Engineering from KU Leuven (2021). 

My research focuses on developing AI-driven solutions for business, emphasizing model performance, interpretability, and uncertainty to tackle real-world challenges. I am passionate about leveraging data and machine learning to create meaningful impact, ensuring technology serves both business and societal needs in a responsible and effective way.
