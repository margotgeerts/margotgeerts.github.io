I am a PhD student at [LIRIS](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/decision-sciences-and-information-management/liris), KU Leuven, working on ML for geospatial data and real estate, supervised by [Jochen De Weerdt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=nl&authuser=1&user=26i8eZMAAAAJ) (KU Leuven) and [Seppe vanden Broucke](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uIfUaMMAAAAJ&hl=nl&authuser=1) (UGent). I received my master's Business and Information Systems Engineering from KU Leuven in 2021.
