I am a PhD student at [LIRIS](https://feb.kuleuven.be/research/decision-sciences-and-information-management/liris), KU Leuven, working on ML for geospatial data and real estate, supervised by Jochen De Weerdt and Seppe vanden Broucke. I received my master's Business and Information Systems Engineering from KU Leuven in 2021.
